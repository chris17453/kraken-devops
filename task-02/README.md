## thoughts
I just took down my k8 cluster. I threw up minikube on my local machine to demo this. 
I did google a few things because i dont k8 as often as I like. Though I've  migrated, built and ran quite a bit of it. It's more like a first date experience every time. I get to touch it and play with it for the task. Then I dont need it anymore till I do.
